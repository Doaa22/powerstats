Produce simple statistics from [REDD](http://redd.csail.mit.edu)-formatted
power data.  Statistics include (for each channel):

* Min, mean, max and stdev for time between consecutive samples.
  (This is useful for checking on the health of sensors.)
* Min, mean, max and stdev for power consumption
* Is the channel sorted by timecode?
